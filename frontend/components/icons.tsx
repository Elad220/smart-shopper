// This file is no longer needed as Material-UI icons are imported directly.
// You can delete this file from your project.
// For example, instead of: import { PlusIcon } from './icons';
// Use: import AddIcon from '@mui/icons-material/Add';
export {}; // Add an empty export to make it a module if file is kept temporarily
